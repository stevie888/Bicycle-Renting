# Place Your Original Logo

## 🎯 **Simple Steps to Use Your Logo:**

### **Step 1: Save Your Logo**
1. **Copy your original pedalNepal logo image**
2. **Paste it into the `public` folder**
3. **Rename it to `logo.png`** (or keep original name)

### **Step 2: Update File Path (if needed)**
If your logo has a different name, update this line in `components/icons.tsx`:
```tsx
src="/your-logo-name.png"  // Change to your actual file name
```

### **Step 3: Test Your Logo**
1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check the navbar** - Your original logo should appear next to ""

## ✅ **What I've Already Set Up:**

- ✅ **Logo component** points to `/logo.png`
- ✅ **Navbar text** shows "BikeShare" 
- ✅ **Navigation links** updated to `/bicycles`

## 🎨 **Your Logo Will Show:**

- **Original pedalNepal logo** with bicycle icon
- **"BikeShare" text** next to it in the navbar
- **Professional appearance** in your bike rental app

## 📁 **File Structure:**
```
public/
├── logo.png          # Your original logo here
├── favicon.ico       # Browser tab icon
└── ...other files
```
